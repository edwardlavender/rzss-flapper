## Introduction

This repository contains methods, written in `R` and organised as an `R Project`, for Cole et al. (in prep). Physiological responses to capture and handling in flapper skate (*Dipturus intermedius*).

We studied the physiological responses of flapper skate following catch-and-release angling and acoustic tagging in the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura Marine Protected Area on the west coast of Scotland (Figure 1). We recorded blood parameters following capture (blood sample one: BS1) and following handling (blood sample two: BS2). Using statistical modelling (as recorded in this repository) we investigated relationships between blood parameters for both BS1 and BS2 and aspects of the capture and handing process (such as fight time), individual characteristics (such as sex) and environmental conditions (such as temperature). This work was conducted as part of the Movement Ecology of Flapper Skate project.

## Structure

1.  **`data-raw/`** contains 'raw' data for the project:
      - `Skate data analysis shared.xlsx` contains raw data collated by G. C. Cole, including the details of capture events and blood parameters. This project is based on the `Data all without formulas` sheet, which details capture events, raw blood parameters and temperature-corrected blood parameter values. The latter are used for analyses in this project. <br/><br/>
      
2.  **`data/`** contains processed data:
      - `physio.rds` contains processed data from `process_data_raw.R` (see below). <br/><br/>

3.  **`R/`** contains scripts for data processing and analysis:
      - `define_global_param.R` defines global parameters.
      - `process_data_raw.R` processes raw data.
      - `analyse_bloods.R` analyses BS1 and BS2.
      - `analyse_bloods_change.R` analyses the change in blood parameters during handling. <br/><br/>
      
4.  **`fig/`** contains tables and figures.

Note that the `data-raw`, `data` and `fig` directories are not provided in the online version of this repository.

## Workflow

1. **Define global parameters** via `define_global_param.R`.

2. **Process raw data** via `process_data_raw.R`.

3. **Implement data analysis** via `analyse_bloods.R` and `analyse_bloods_change.R`. 

# GitHub packages

This repository uses a number of non-default packages, available from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org). These can be installed with `install.packages()`. Two packages that are only available on [GitHub](https://github.com/) are also used:

  - [`prettyGraphics`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/prettyGraphics). This package is used for plotting, e.g., via `pretty_predictions_1d()`.
  - [`utils.add`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/utils.add). This package is used occasionally for summarising data or function outputs.
